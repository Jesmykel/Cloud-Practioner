Attach the required IAM policy to an IAM identity

From the previous hands on, I already attached a IAM policy (billingfullaccess) to a IAM identity (FinanceManager)

Review your bills and usage

I used features in the Billing console to view your current AWS charges and AWS usage.

To open the Billing console and view your usage and charges

I signed into the AWS Management Console and opened the Billing console

I choose Bills to see details about my current charges.

I choose Payments to see my historical payment transactions.

I choose AWS Cost and Usage Reports to see reports that break down my costs.


Download or print your bill

To download your bill

On the navigation pane, I choose Bills.

For Date, I choose the month of the bill I want to work with.

I then Choose Download CSV to download a comma-separated variable file or choose Print.
