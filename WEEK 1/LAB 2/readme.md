Your task in this lab is to create 

1. Groups and add the corresponding user

I created users individually for the people in the organisation baering their individual names and added policies according to their their roles in the organisation, I then then created group names "Expert" "Support" then "Finance" and added the individual users according to their roles in the organisation 

2. Enforce a password policy

I enforced a passowrod policy stated below;
8 character long
Must include an uppercase letter
Must include integers
Password reset upon next login

3. Perform clean up operations

I then performe a clean operation by clearing all operations performed in the IAM service

Below are screenshoot for final output of the user group created and their individual users.
